## The purpose of the project

* To create an applicaition for users to look for defintiions in regards to the game Call Of Duty warzone and understand what terms mean in the game, and also to allow users to create an account for them to create their own definitons for new words and to be able to then update the site aswell as being able to delete their definitions if they arent happy with it. For Data handling, i will be using MongoDB and flask to achieve the Data handling aspect of the application, aswell as using HTML and custom CSS for the website's front-end.
